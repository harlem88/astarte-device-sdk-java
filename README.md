# Astarte Java Device SDK

This SDK should be used to connect any device running Android (or any Java application) to Astarte.

Virtually an SDK is not required to connect an application to Astarte using MQTT, but it enables
rapid development and a pleasant developer experience.

## Requirements
### Device SDK Android
- Android system API level >= 23 (Android 6.0).

### Device SDK Generic
- Java version >= 1.8.

## Usage

See the `examples` folder for usage examples.
